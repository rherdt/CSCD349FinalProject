            First, choose a difficulty. Easy, normal, and hard have 5, 10, and 15 levels, respectively. Next, choose the party you would like to play as.
            Each party has a different skillset, so choose the one that fits your style best.

            Use the arrow keys to move your character in the direction you would like to move your party. Each square can contain an enemy,
            (which are hidden from view), an inventory item, a new weapon (which are hidden from view), or treasure. Landing on an enemy
            will automatically start a battle. Landing on an inventory item will automatically add that item to your inventory, as long as
            there is sufficient space. Landing on a new weapon will automatically give that weapon to the party member with the weapon that
            has the lowest attack, as the new weapon is gauranteed to be better. Do your best to get to the stairs in the top right corner
            of the map. If you reach the stairs, you will either move to the next floor (level), or if you have already reached the last floor
            you will have completed the game successfully.

            A battle is initiated if the party lands on an enemy space. To win the battle, you must attack the enemy party until they have no
            more hit points left. Game play is turned-based. On your turn, you have the option to attack the enemy, use an applicable inventory
            item, or try to run away. If you lose all your hit points before you can defeat the enemy, you lose the game.
